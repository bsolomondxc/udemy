For all the code I develop as part of the UDEMY course work. Most of this code is very basic and you can feel free to use it if you wish.
Of course, I make no claims or warranties and in the unlikely event that your life is negatively affected by this code, I will take no responsibility. :) Enjoy. Or not.
